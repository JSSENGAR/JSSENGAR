About Me :

I'm a full stack developer who believe in user friendly application creation and complete user satisfaction. I’ve been developing and architecting web applications for over 5+ years working in a wide variety of technologies like (.net C#, MVC, Angular, React and Laravel ) with backend (MSSQL and MYSQL) for small businesses, large corporations, and out on my own doing freelance work. I’m passionate about coding and building rich, powerful apps using the latest technologies. I am an avid technical reader and enjoy speaking regularly at developer meetups across the country. I consistently strive to improve my techniques and toolset to solve real-world problems. I believe performance is a feature and responsive UI is worth the extra work. I strive to be a top-tier developer and recognize this demands excellent communication skills, continuous learning, and natural curiosity.

♦ So what makes me unique? ★ 

I write clean, reliable code that anyone can read by using best practices. People I worked with know me as a great time utilizer and effective engineer because technically I love to finish work within time.
